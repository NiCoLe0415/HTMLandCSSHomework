                    <p>The Cinque Terre National Park is the smallest and oldest National Park in Italy, and was designated back in 1999. 
                        It covers an area of only 15 square miles but packs plenty of gorgeous scenery into a small space, with a mix of rocky cliffs, 
                        scenic coves, clear blue waters, terraced vineyards and olive groves linked by a network of footpaths.

                        The Cinque Terre is located just south of Genoa in northwest Italy. 
                        It’s within easy reach of the airports at Genoa, Pisa, Rome, Florence and Nice by mainline train, 
                        and there’s a local train between La Spezia and Levanto which stops at each of the villages.</p>
                    <p>People often talk about the Cinque Terre like it’s one place, but it’s actually a stretch of Italian Riveira 
                        coastline made up of five separate villages – known as the Five Lands or Cinque Terre in Italian (which is pronounced cheen-kweh teh-rreh).

                        Running from north to south the villages are Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore. 
                        Each one of the five is a beauty, with pastel buildings tumbling down the hillsides and sparkling sea views, 
                        but each has its own different character.</p>

                    <p>The Cinque Terre’s never exactly quiet – peak season runs all the way from Easter until October. 
                        But to avoid the worst of the crowds, steer clear of July and August. Accommodation gets booked up really 
                        far in advance in the summer and it can be really hot and dry, with average highs of 29ºC/84ºF, so isn’t 
                        the best time for walking.

                        Shoulder season – May and September – is a good time for visiting the Cinque Terre, with warm days around and 
                        fewer people than in peak season. Spring sees average high temperatures around 17–21ºC/63–70ºF and is mostly dry. 
                        October and November are the wettest months and there’s a risk of heavy thunderstorms causing landslips.</p>
                        
                    <p>Or if you want to risk the off-season you can get a bargain and have the paths to yourself in December and January. 
                        Though some restaurants and accommodation closes down in winter, and you risk boats being suspended and hiking trails
                         closed in bad weather.</p>

                    <p>The Cinque Terre is a National Park, so vehicle traffic is restricted to residents only in the villages and 
                        it’s best to avoid taking a car if you can (not least because the roads are terrifyingly narrow and winding
                         with sheer drops). If you are driving around, you can park in La Spezia or Levanto then catch the train into 
                         the Cinque Terre.

                        Trains are the easiest way to get to and around the Cinque Terre, running between La Spezia and 
                        Levanto and stopping at each village. You can also connect to Genoa, Pisa, Rome and beyond. It only takes about 
                        five minutes from one village to the next. Tickets cost €5 for a single journey (free with the Cinque Terre Train Card), 
                        irrespective of how far you go.</p>
                    <p>You can’t reserve seats and the queues on the platforms can be crazy, but trains are long and they often use double-decker 
                        carriages so can squeeze a lot of people in. Trains run up to three times an hour in each direction from 5am–11.30pm, and you 
                        can pick up or print out a timetable. And don’t forget to validate your ticket before boarding.

                        There’s also a ferry connecting the villages (other than Corniglia) with Portovenere, La Spezia and Levanto from March to November. 
                        It’s worth a trip to check out the views. A day ticket with unlimited journeys costs €35 adults/€20 children, or you can get cheaper
                         afternoon or single tickets. You can also rent a boat or take a sailing trip.</p>

                    <p>There are a few churches and monuments you can visit around the Cinque Terre but it’s mostly all about the outdoors.
                         As well as walking you can get out on the water – go sailing*, swimming, take a kayaking trip* or go diving and 
                         snorkelling from Riomaggiore.

                        Don’t miss trying the local seafood, with cones of fried calamari, shrimp and anchovies available everywhere. 
                        It goes brilliantly with the local white wine. The hills behind the villages are covered in vineyard terraces and 
                        you can do a tasting at some of the wineries.</p>
                    <p>And look out for some of the annual festivals, like Saints’ Days, Easter processions, 
                        the lemon festival in May and anchovy festival in June, the grape harvest festival and Monterosso’s 
                        bizarre cuckold festival in November.</p>
